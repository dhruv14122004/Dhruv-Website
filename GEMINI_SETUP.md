# Gemini AI Integration Instructions

## 🚀 Setup Complete!

Your AI agent is now integrated with Google's Gemini AI! Here's what you need to do:

## 1. Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key

## 2. Configure Your Environment

1. Open `/frontend/.env` file
2. Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. Save the file

## 3. Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Features Added

- ✅ **Real AI Responses**: Your AI agent now uses Google's Gemini Pro model
- ✅ **Fallback System**: If API is unavailable, it uses smart fallback responses
- ✅ **Context Awareness**: AI knows about Dhruv's skills, projects, and background
- ✅ **Conversation Memory**: AI remembers recent conversation context
- ✅ **Professional Tone**: AI responds professionally representing Dhruv
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with fallback responses
- ✅ **Visual Indicator**: Shows "⚡ Powered by Gemini" when API is configured

## 🔒 Security

- Your API key is stored in `.env` which is now added to `.gitignore`
- Never commit your API key to version control
- The key is only accessible in the frontend build

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User sends message** → AI agent receives it
2. **Context building** → Adds Dhruv's information and conversation history
3. **Gemini API call** → Sends request to Google's Gemini Pro model
4. **Response processing** → Cleans and formats the AI response
5. **Fallback handling** → Uses smart fallbacks if API fails

## 💡 Tips

- The AI is trained to represent Dhruv professionally
- It will guide visitors to relevant portfolio sections
- It encourages potential employers to reach out
- Responses are limited to ~150 words for better UX
- The AI maintains conversation context for natural flow

## ✅ Verify Your Setup

To verify your API key is working correctly:
1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open the AI Agent**: Click the cat button in bottom-right
3. **Send a test message**: Ask any question about Dhruv
4. **Look for the indicator**: You should see "⚡ Powered by Gemini" if the API is working

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Model Not Found Error (404)
If you see `models/gemini-pro is not found`:
- ✅ **Fixed Automatically**: The system now tries multiple models (`gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, etc.)
- ✅ **Auto-Detection**: It will automatically find and use the best available model
- ✅ **Fallback**: If no models work, it gracefully falls back to smart responses

### API Key Issues
- **Invalid Key**: Double-check your API key from Google AI Studio
- **Permissions**: Make sure your API key has Gemini access enabled
- **Environment**: Restart dev server after changing `.env` file

---

**Need help?** The AI agent gracefully handles errors and will always provide helpful responses even if the API is temporarily unavailable.
