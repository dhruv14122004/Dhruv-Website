# Gemini AI Integration Instructions

## 🚀 Setup Complete!

Your AI agent is now integrated with Google's Gemini AI through a secure backend API! Here's what you need to do:

## 1. Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy your API key

## 2. Configure Your Backend Environment

1. Open `/backend/.env` file
2. Update the `GEMINI_API_KEY` with your actual API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. Save the file

## 3. Start Your Servers

**Backend (Terminal 1):**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Frontend (Terminal 2):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Features Added

- ✅ **Secure Backend Integration**: API key is safely stored on the server
- ✅ **Real AI Responses**: Your AI agent uses Google's Gemini model through backend API
- ✅ **Fallback System**: If backend/API is unavailable, uses smart fallback responses
- ✅ **Context Awareness**: AI knows about Dhruv's skills, projects, and background
- ✅ **Conversation Memory**: AI remembers recent conversation context
- ✅ **Professional Tone**: AI responds professionally representing Dhruv
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with fallback responses
- ✅ **Visual Indicator**: Shows "⚡ Powered by Gemini" when API is configured
- ✅ **Security**: API key never exposed to frontend/browser

## 🔒 Security

- Your API key is stored in `/backend/.env` which is secure and not exposed to browsers
- Never commit your API key to version control
- The frontend only communicates with your backend, not directly with Google's API
- Backend validates all requests and handles API communication securely

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User sends message** → Frontend sends to your backend API
2. **Backend processes** → Adds Dhruv's information and conversation history
3. **Gemini API call** → Backend calls Google's Gemini model securely
4. **Response processing** → Backend cleans and formats the AI response
5. **Frontend receives** → Displays the response to the user
6. **Fallback handling** → Uses smart fallbacks if backend/API fails

## 💡 Tips

- Keep both backend and frontend running for full AI functionality
- The AI is trained to represent Dhruv professionally
- Backend handles all API complexity and security
- Frontend gracefully handles backend unavailability
- Responses are limited to ~150 words for better UX
- The AI maintains conversation context for natural flow

## ✅ Verify Your Setup

To verify your API key is working correctly:
1. **Start your development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open the AI Agent**: Click the cat button in bottom-right
3. **Send a test message**: Ask any question about Dhruv
4. **Look for the indicator**: You should see "⚡ Powered by Gemini" if the API is working

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Model Not Found Error (404)
If you see `models/gemini-pro is not found`:
- ✅ **Fixed Automatically**: The system now tries multiple models (`gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, etc.)
- ✅ **Auto-Detection**: It will automatically find and use the best available model
- ✅ **Fallback**: If no models work, it gracefully falls back to smart responses

### API Key Issues
- **Invalid Key**: Double-check your API key from Google AI Studio
- **Permissions**: Make sure your API key has Gemini access enabled
- **Environment**: Restart dev server after changing `.env` file

---

**Need help?** The AI agent gracefully handles errors and will always provide helpful responses even if the API is temporarily unavailable.
